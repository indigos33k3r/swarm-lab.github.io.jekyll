As part of an ongoing expansion, the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://biology.njit.edu/) at the [New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)](https://www.njit.edu) is looking to fill one or two new tenure-track faculty positions at the Assistant Professor level, beginning in 2017. We seek applicants with an interest and established record in bridging levels from systems or organismic function to behavior or ecology. Research areas can include - but are not limited to - ethology, microbiology, functional ecology, or evolution. Candidates will be expected to maintain an active, funded research program, supervise graduate students, and contribute to the overall success of the Department.

NJIT is a tier-one public research university located in Newark, NJ, with an emphasis on STEM subjects. The Department of Biological Sciences at NJIT currently consists of ten research faculty with expertise in neurobiology, sensory and motor systems, locomotion, collective behavior, and functional and spatial ecology. The Department is also Federated with neighboring [Rutgers-University Newark](http://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/biology), adding colleagues in cellular neurobiology, cell signaling, genetics, systematics, evolution and ecology. The successful applicant will occupy customizable space in a newly renovated research facility. Duties will also include teaching introductory and upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses, depending on expertise.

NJIT is an equal-opportunity employer. Applications from minorities and women are especially welcome.  

Applicants should upload a CV, a cover letter, and a statement of research interest at the following address: [njit.jobs/applicants/Central?quickFind=55733](http://njit.jobs/applicants/Central?quickFind=55733). In addition, they should arrange for at least three references to send letters directly to Ms. Shamay Carty at [carty@njit.edu](mailto:carty@njit.edu).

All inquiries should be directed to Dr. Simon Garnier, at [garnier@njit.edu](mailto:garnier@njit.edu).
