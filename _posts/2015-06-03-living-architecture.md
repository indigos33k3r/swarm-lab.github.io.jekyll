description:
    We investigate the mechanisms by which army ants of the genus <i>Eciton</i> form dynamical structures out of their 
    own bodies, by attaching to each other using special morphological adaptations. These collective "living" constructions
    allow them to create temporary nests and support structures along their densely populated foraging and migratory trails.
