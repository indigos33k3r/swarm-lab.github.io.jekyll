description:
    Robots are fun, even the dumb ones - maybe especially the dumb ones. At the Swarm Lab we use swarms of miniature 
    robots with limited processing and movement capabilities to test bio-inspired coordination algorithms. We also 
    create educational tools using our robots to demonstrate the functioning of social insect colonies.
