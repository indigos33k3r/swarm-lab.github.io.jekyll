description:
    The R programming language is one of the most popular languages for data processing and visualization. It is widely
    used in academia and industry, and its open-source nature has created a large community of users and contributors 
    around the world. At the Swarm Lab, R is our favorite data processing and visualization tool (though we also like 
    Python, Matlab, Java, C/C++), and from time to time we develop and release new libraries for R.
    <br><br>
    A complete portfolio of our R libraries will be soon available here. 
    <br><br>
    In the meantime, you can check out our <a href="https://github.com/swarm-lab">GitHub repos</a>.
