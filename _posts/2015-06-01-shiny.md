description: 
    <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> is a library for the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R programming 
    language</a> with which one can build interactive web applications. It is developed by the terrific team behind the 
    <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio IDE</a>. We use this framework in class to showcase classic models of 
    collective behaviors and swarm intelligence. The students can manipulate the parameters of these models using simple 
    sliders and buttons, and observe directly the consequences on the modelsâ€™ predictions. This is a fantastic way to 
    design interactive assignments to complement the content of a lecture or to prepare the students for the next one.
