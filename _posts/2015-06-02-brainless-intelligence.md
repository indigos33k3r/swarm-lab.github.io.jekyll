description:
    The slime mold <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> is probably one of the most bizarre living organism. This giant (it can
    be easily observed with the naked eye), multi-nucleated cell is capable of solving convoluted labyrinth mazes, 
    challenging optimization problems and even construct transport networks that have similar efficiency to those 
    designed by human engineers. At the Swarm Lab we study how these incredible performances emerge from the dynamics of 
    this brainless creature.
